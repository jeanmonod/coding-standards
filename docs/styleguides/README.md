# Style Guides

We tend to create [living style guides](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/creating-a-living-style-guide-case-study/) to document our projects’ front-end components. We like to use [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) for this purpose as it provides a lot of features and can be easily customized.

Since Fractal doesn’t handle assets management on its own, we made [our own starterkit](https://github.com/liip/styleguide-starterkit) that is preconfigured with a couple of tools, especially webpack.

Check out the [Liip Styleguide](https://styleguide.liip.ch/) for an example.
