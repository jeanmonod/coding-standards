# Tools

This is a list of tools we frenquently use for various projects.

## Drifter

Most projects we do use [Drifter](https://github.com/liip/drifter) as a common base for local environement setup. It has a [webpack role](https://liip-drifter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roles/webpack.html) you can enable to automatically set it up.

## Styleguide Starterkit

The [Styleguide Starterkit](https://github.com/liip/styleguide-starterkit) is a boilerplate to scaffold new style guides using Fractal preconfigured with webpack.

## Kanbasu

[Kanbasu](https://kanbasu.liip.ch/) is our open-source Sass framework that we use on almost all projects. It serves as a set of common components and helpers to build interfaces.

## Vue CLI

When creating a new Single Page App with Vue.js, we favor the official [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to generate the project foundations. It comes with a large panel of preconfigured plugins and includes our usual tools (webpack, EsLint, Prettier, Jest, Cypress, â€¦).
